# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction System

Welcome to the **Loan Approval Prediction** project!  
This application allows users to submit personal and financial information to predict, using a machine learning model, whether a loan will likely be **approved** or **rejected**.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|:--|:--|
| Python + Flask | Machine Learning backend API |
| Scikit-Learn, XGBoost | Model training and prediction |
| React + Vite + TypeScript + TailwindCSS | Frontend web application |
| Pandas, NumPy | Data preprocessing |
| Joblib | Model persistence |

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes features like:
- **Personal Information** (Age, Gender, Education)
- **Financial Status** (Income, Employment Experience)
- **Loan Details** (Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Loan % of Income)
- **Credit History** (Credit Score, Previous Defaults)

**Target:**
- `loan_status` (1 = Approved, 0 = Rejected)

## 🔁 Model Performance Comparison: Before vs After Normalization

### ✅ Summary Table

| Model                  | Accuracy (Before) | Accuracy (After) | Precision (Before) | Precision (After) | False Negatives (Before → After) |
|------------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Linear Regression**  | 0.8926            | 0.8926           | 0.798               | 0.798              | 622 → 622                         |
| **Logistic Regression**| 0.8820            | 0.8923           | 0.735               | 0.765              | 539 → 515 ✅                       |
| **Random Forest**      | 0.9309            | 0.9307           | 0.900               | 0.899              | 452 → 452                         |
| **KNN (Tuned)**        | 0.8360            | 0.9002 🔥        | 0.689               | 0.827              | 1054 → 609 🔥                     |
| **XGBoost**            | 0.9362            | 0.9362           | 0.889               | 0.889              | 372 → 372                         |

### 🧠 Observations

- 🔥 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** showed the **most significant improvement**:
  - Accuracy jumped by **6.4%**
  - False Negatives dropped by nearly **450 cases**
  - Precision rose from **68.9% → 82.7%**

- ✅ **Logistic Regression** also benefited from normalization, improving across all key metrics.

- 🧱 **Random Forest** and ⚡ **XGBoost** remained highly stable — expected behavior due to their **scale-invariance**.

- 📉 **Linear Regression (converted)** showed no change, as expected.

### 🏆 Final Recommendations

| Goal                     | Best Model             |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Minimize False Negatives** | 🔥 KNN (normalized)       |
| **Maximize Accuracy + Precision** | ⚡ XGBoost / 🌲 Random Forest |
| **Balance + Interpretability** | ✅ Logistic Regression    |
