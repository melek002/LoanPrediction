ðŸš€ Loan Prediction Web App

This repository contains my submission for a university project in the Business Analytics module.
It demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict loan approvals.
ðŸ›  Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:
1. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Download the Dataset

Download the dataset used for training and testing the model from this Medium article.

ðŸ“‚ Place the dataset in your project directory as loan_data.csv.
3. Train the Model

Use the provided Jupyter Notebook to train the model:

jupyter notebook newloan.ipynb

This will generate a trained pipeline and save it as loan_pipeline.pkl.

(Alternatively, you can use the provided pretrained loan_pipeline.pkl directly.)
4. Run the Web App

Start the Flask web server:

python app.py

The API will be available locally at:

http://localhost:5000

You can now make loan approval predictions via the web app frontend or API requests!
ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
File	Description
newloan.ipynb	Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
app.py	Flask app that hosts the trained model as a web API for predictions.
requirements.txt	: List of all required Python packages.
loan_pipeline.pkl	Pretrained loan prediction model (generated after training).
loan_data.csv	Dataset for training and testing (needs to be downloaded).
