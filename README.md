🏦 Loan Approval Prediction System
Welcome to the Loan Approval Prediction project!
This application allows users to submit personal and financial information to predict whether a loan will likely be approved or rejected, using a Machine Learning model.

🚀 Technologies Used

Technology	Purpose
Python + Flask	Machine Learning backend API
Scikit-Learn, XGBoost	Model training and prediction
React + Vite + TypeScript + TailwindCSS	Frontend web application
Pandas, NumPy	Data preprocessing
Joblib	Model persistence
📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes features like:

Personal Information (Age, Gender, Education)

Financial Status (Income, Employment Experience)

Loan Details (Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Loan % of Income)

Credit History (Credit Score, Previous Defaults)

Target:

loan_status (1 = Approved, 0 = Rejected)

📦 Model Training Summary
Features were scaled using StandardScaler.

Categorical variables were encoded using OneHotEncoder.

Models compared: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost.

Best model selected based on highest Accuracy and Precision after hyperparameter tuning.

📈 Final Model Metrics (Best KNN after Scaling)

Metric	Score
Accuracy	~90%
Precision	~82%
Recall	~69%
F1 Score	~75%
🌟 Future Improvements
Add email notification after prediction

Deploy fullstack to Render/Netlify

Add user authentication

Store application history in a database
